# 1-2 Paragraphs of SEO knowledge
When a website is deployed on search engines, those search engines have crawlers that go through the
website and look for keywords.  If the keywords match what the user is searching for, then the website
will appear in the search engine results.  The more in common the website has with the user's searches,
the higher up the website will be on the search results.  Search Engine Optimization is the process of
implementing tools and content that will rank the website's pages higher in search engines, which in
turn leads to more organic traffic on the website.

To help improve SEO, there are a variety of tools and tricks a developer can use to increase the website's
score.  Google Analytics shows which buttons are clicked and what pages users visit which helps determine where
content should be placed on the website.  Heat Maps also helps with placement of content.  In addition, knowing what
tags to use in the code and when is important.  For example, if there is more than 1 <h1> tag, this could confuse the
crawler as the h tags are judged on importance based on their number.    

## Detail Plan of Ideal SEO

When it comes to SEO's, single page applications are not ideal because it makes it difficult for Google
and other crawlers to display your website properly in the search results.  With a universal application
such as Nuxt.js, tags such as <meta>, <head>, and <h1> in the body help crawlers determine what is on
the page.  One of the ways that would be ideal to improve SEO is to set up a <meta> tag for all my
pages.  As part of the tag, it would ideal to incorporate the hid property as well so that the site won't
be penalized for having duplicate tags.
